let a = 50 // ...0110010
let b = 100 //...1100100

let c = a & b
//"c" should be equal to ...1110110 which is "32" in  decimal

console.log(c)

// & -> AND operation
// | -> OR operation
// ^ -> XOR operation
// ~ -> NOT operation 
// The NOT inverts the 32bit value of the variable before converting it to a decimal. It also inverts the sign
